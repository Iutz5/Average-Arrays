I did not work with a buddy on this assignment

It took me about an hour to finish this assignment

I liked the assignment. It used prior math skills and combined it with new
techniques of coding and problem solving to be able to figure out the task at
hand.

The only concern I have for this assignment is the directions. I like how you are
starting to give us more freedom on the hard code numbers to let us think of a
solution before just immediately coming to you for help, but the way my brain
processes it was hard to start on a project without any general direction. However,
I understand that in the real world I will have to figure out the direction myself,
so once I started to get rolling I started liking the assignment more!
